# React Example Demo Application

This project illustrates how a complex React Component can be documented via the markdown-based components in @js-demo/demopage

The implementation here is a REST-api/Redux based TODOs component, similar to other React/Redux Tutorials

INCOMPLETE: work in progress - need to enhance the ability of the demopage component 

## Starting the Demo

```yarn start-demo```
