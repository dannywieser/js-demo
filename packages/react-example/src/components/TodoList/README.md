# TodoList Example Component

The TodoList component is an example React Component that implements the common todo list example based on a Redux Data Service.

This demo relies on a fake TODOs api (run via JSON-server) - to run use the command:

```yarn start-api```

Then run the local server: ```yarn start-demo```

## Demo

<TodoList />

## Properties

The TodoList component takes no properties, but relies on the presence of the Todos Redux data store.
